## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Sometimes I need to make create projects NOW: in the moment. 

Some days I just need to release something, even if it is not finished. 

That is why I have this account.

To keep myself accountable.

To say for some projects, "it is alright that it is not finished."

To say for some projects, "it can be seen."


## "Micro-Obsessions"

I have way too many ideas.

I like to call them "micro-obsessions."

Sometimes I forget about them.

Then when I rediscover them, it takes a while to get back up to speed.

That is another reason why I have this account.

To remember and document stuff in an easy way that I can pick it up again.
